== Description ==

This theme is great for building a restaurant website with online ordering in no time at all.

* The design is sales oriented, focusing on the true needs of a restaurant client;
* The theme uses the GloriaFood plugin to enable restaurants take online orders and table reservations free of charge;
* Setting up the theme and the plugin is very easy. And together, they unlock big (free) features, from online ordering to receipt printing and website statistics.
